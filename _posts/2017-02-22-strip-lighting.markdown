## Strip Lighting
- Strips of LED's allow you to cover just about anything in bright LED lights!
- Can be color changing (RGB) or standard white (WW) or both (RGBWW)

### Strips 
#### What is RGB and RGBWW
  - RGB = Red Green Blue
  - This means that each diode of the LED bulb has three smaller LEDs inside of it - one Red, one Green, and one Blue. By dimming the individual R, G, and B elements at different amounts, you can mix together nearly any color you can imaine!

#### 150 vs 300 LED's per 5M
  - Standard strip length is 5 meters, or 16.4 feet
  - Some strips have 150 LEDs per 5M, some have 300
     - 300 LEDs per strip will be twice as bright but use twice as much electricity. 
     - However, since LEDs are so energy efficient, Lighthome reccommends 300 LEDs per strip for typical usage.
