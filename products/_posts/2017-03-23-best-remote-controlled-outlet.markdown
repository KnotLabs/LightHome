Remember [the Clapper](http://amzn.to/2nOoD7i)? "Clap on... clap off... the clapper!" Feels like they were a staple TV ad when I was growing up. These days I wouldn't recommend a Clapper to a friend. When it comes to controlling lights and outlets the options are endless.

After lots of different types of switches and controllers I have tested, one stands alone in its excellence. The Etekcity Wireless Remote Control Electrical Outlet (also known as the Etekcity Zap) is the best piece of tech I have bought in years. It works by plugging one of the Etekcity outlets into an existing outlet in your home, then any device into the Etekcity outlet. Using the remote you can turn on and off the outlet switching on and off the device plugged into the Etekcity outlet.

It can be used for just about any device in your home. I use them in my apartment to turn my lights, lamps, white noise machine, and projector on and off. What makes them so great is they use radio frequency (RF) so you don't need a line of site to the outlet like you would with a TV remote and the TV. They have a 100 foot range and can travel through walls with ease so I can tuck the outlets away and they will still work seamlessly.

Another advantage to them being RF is that you don't need to actually point the remote at the outlets them selfs. This makes for some very clever placement of the removes. I have one remote attached to my wall with Command Velcro strips which turns into an alternative to my light switch for all of my devices.

I have the second remote also fastened to the edge of my nightstand. This is probably the favorite part of my setup. It makes controlling my room from my bed dead simple and best of all when I go to sleep I don't have to walk in the dark to my best, I just get into bed and click off the lights from the remote.

One of the best features of the Etekcity Zap is that all of the outlets are programmable and can listen on up to 3 channels. We use this in our apartment for our living room and kitchen. We set the lights on the kitchen outlet to Channel 1 and 5 on the remote and the light in the living room to Channel 2 and 5 on the same remote. This makes it so we can turn each one on or off individually on channel 1 or 2 but will turn them both on or off by clicking 5 on the remote. Pretty neat huh?

The package comes with 5 outlets and 2 remotes and for the price, it is a no-brainer. Whether you use them to turn on lamps, Christmas lights, white noise machines, record players, projectors, or fans, the Etekcity Zap wireless remote control set is a 10 out of 10 would recommend to every friend I know.
