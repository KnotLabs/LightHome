Remember [the Clapper](http://amzn.to/2nOoD7i)? "Clap on... clap off... the clapper!" Feels like they were a staple TV ad when I was growing up. These days, the options to control lights and outlets are endless, and I wouldn't recommend the Clapper to a friend.

I have personally tested numerous switches and controllers and have found one that far exceeds the rest. The Etekcity Wireless Remote Control Electrical Outlet (also known as the Etekcity Zap) is the best piece of tech I have bought in years. The system is extremely user friendly, just plug one of the Etekcity outlets into any existing outlet in your home. Once you plug a device into Etekcity outlet, it can easily be controlled by a portable remote.

It can be used for just about any device in your home. I use them in my apartment to turn my lights, lamps, white noise machine, and projector on and off. What makes them so great is they use radio frequency (RF) so you don't need a line of sight to the outlet like you would with a TV remote and the TV. The range is 100 feet and easily travels through walls. This allows for the outlets to be tucked away and still function seamlessly.

A real advantage to the radio frequency system is the ability to place remotes in your space as they will best serve you. I have one remote attached to my wall next to my light switch with Command velcro strips, which allows me to control all my devices easily when entering or exiting the room.

I have my second remote fastened to the edge of my nightstand. This is probably my favorite part of my personal set up. I'm able to hop into bed and shut my lights off without trying to navigate in the dark.

One of the best features of the Etekcity Zap is that all of the outlets are programmable and can listen on up to 3 channels. We use this in our apartment for our living room and kitchen. We set the lights on the kitchen outlet to Channel 1 and 5 on the remote and the light in the living room to Channel 2 and 5 on the same remote. This makes it so we can turn each one on or off individually on channel 1 or 2 but will turn them both on or off by clicking 5 on the remote. Pretty neat huh?

The package comes with 5 outlets and 2 remotes and for the price, it is a no-brainer. Whether you use them to turn on lamps, Christmas lights, white noise machines, record players, projectors, or fans, the Etekcity Zap wireless remote control set is a 10 out of 10 would recommend to every friend I know.
