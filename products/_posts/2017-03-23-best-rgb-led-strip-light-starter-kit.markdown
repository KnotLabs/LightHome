This is the best starter kit to try out some LED lighting without breaking the bank. You can easily illuminate an entire room with just one strip and at less than $20, this is the best way to dip your feet into the world of RGB LED lighting.

This kit has everything you need to get started, including an RGB LED strip, an IR remote control, and a power source. This kit is great for accent lighting, to create a party atmosphere, or to light your room in a fun way. Whenever a friend comes to me asking questions about cool color changing lights and are wondering where to get started, I always send them to this kit. It is hands down the simplest, cheapest, and easiest way to get started with cool color changing accent lighting.

For an even simpler set up, pair the starter kit with a [Remote Controlled Outlet]({{ site.url }}/products/best-remote-controlled-outlet) and you'll be able to turn these lights on and off with a convenient remote switch!
