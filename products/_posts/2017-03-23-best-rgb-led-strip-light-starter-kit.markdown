title: Best RGB LED Strip Light Starter Kit
---

Looking to add some accent lighting to your bedroom, part lighting for your dorm room, or general illumination for any room, but not sure where to start? This is the best starter kit to try out some LED lighting without breaking the bank. You can easily illuminate an entire room with just one strip and at less than $20, this is the best way to dip your feet into the world of RGB LED lighting.

This kit comes with the three things you need to light a room with an LED strip, an [LED strip light](), a [controller](), and a [power source](). The LED strip comes with a sticky 3M adhesive on the back so you can mount it right on your wall, around your door or window frame, under your cabinets, or anywhere else you can imagine! I also highly recommend getting some [clear duct tape](http://amzn.to/2oaR7F5) (its what I use!) to assist in mounting these, especially if you move them, because once you use the adhesive it doesn't work very well a second time.

The IR remote controller will let you change the brightness, color, and effects like fading between colors, strobing, etc. Since its an IR remote, you'll need line of sight, but that usually isn't a problem for most. The remote is dead simple to use, and lets you control all aspects of the LED strip.

This kit has everything you need to get started, including an RGB LED strip, an IR remote control, and a power source. This kit is great for accent lighting, to create a party atmosphere, or to light your room in a fun way. Whenever a friend comes to me asking questions about cool color changing lights and are wondering where to get started, I always send them to this kit. It is hands down the simplest, cheapest, and easiest way to get started with cool color changing accent lighting.

For an even simpler set up, pair the starter kit with a [Remote Controlled Outlet]({{ site.url }}/products/best-remote-controlled-outlet) and you'll be able to turn these lights on and off with a convenient remote switch!
