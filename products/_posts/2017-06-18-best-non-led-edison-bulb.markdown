Edison bulbs are a great retro look for any room, to class up the space and add a warm yellow glow. While we usually recommend LED Edison bulbs, sometimes for particular dimmers you need to use a standard incandescent bulb and these are truly the best. While they are not nearly as energy efficient as their LED cousins, they look amazing and will create a beautiful warm ambiance in any room.
