If you have ever had the issue where your tv or projector doesn't have enough HDMI inputs, an HDMI switch is what you need. An HDMI switch is a small device that has multiple HDMI inputs and one HDMI output. Most HDMI switches have a remote control and/or buttons on the switch itself so that you can switch between the inputs. In our apartment, we have a projector that only has one HDMI input, but we want to plug our AppleTV, our Playstation 4, and our Xbox One into it. An HDMI switch solves our problem - we plug our AppleTV, PS4, and Xbox all into the HDMI switch, and plug the one output from the HDMI switch into the projector. And when we want to change inputs, we can use the included remote control, or even easier: we can just turn on a single device and the HDMI switch will automatically switch to the input of the device we turned on.

This HDMI switch is a great deal, especially at only $15. It supports the latest HDMI spec up to 4K quality, and has 5 inputs and 1 output, so you can connect 5 devices into just one HDMI port on your tv / projector. It even comes with a bonus feature: the remote control receiver has a cable, which is useful if you have all your devices in a cabinet and/or if you have a universal remote. It allows you to stash the HDMI switch in a cabinet somewhere but still have the IR receiver wherever is most useful to you.

If you also need to split your audio out separately (for example if you have a separate surround sound setup, or a projector or tv without speakers), we suggest getting [The Best HDMI Switch with Audio Out](https://lighthome.co/random/best-hdmi-switch-with-audio-out). This switch only has 4 inputs and one output, but it has the bonus of separately splitting the audio out via S/PDIF optical and RCA left / right.
