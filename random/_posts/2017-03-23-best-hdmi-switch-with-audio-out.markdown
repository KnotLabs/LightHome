If you need to connect more than one input to a tv or projector with only one HDMI input, you need an HDMI switch. If you also need to split your audio out separately (for example if you have a separate surround sound setup, or a projector or tv without speakers, this is the HDMI switch to get! It has 4 HDMI inputs, and 1 HDMI output, 1 digital optical S/PDIF TOSLINK, and 1 RCA (red/white left/right audio cables) output. If don't need to split audio out separately, we suggest getting [The Best HDMI Switch](https://lighthome.co/random/best-hdmi-switch) that we've come across.
