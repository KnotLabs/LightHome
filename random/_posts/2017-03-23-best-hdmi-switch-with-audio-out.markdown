If you have ever had the issue where your tv or projector doesn't have enough HDMI inputs, an HDMI switch is what you need. An HDMI switch is a small device that has multiple HDMI inputs and one HDMI output. Most HDMI switches have a remote control and/or buttons on the switch itself so that you can switch between the inputs. In our apartment, we have a projector that only has one HDMI input, but we want to plug our AppleTV, our Playstation 4, and our Xbox One into it. An HDMI switch solves our problem - we plug our AppleTV, PS4, and Xbox all into the HDMI switch, and plug the one output from the HDMI switch into the projector. And when we want to change inputs, we can use the included remote control, or even easier: we can just turn on a single device and the HDMI switch will automatically switch to the input of the device we turned on.

This HDMI switch is a good deal and very high quality, in fact its the very HDMI switch that we use in our apartment and we love it. We use this one instead of the cheaper [Best HDMI Switch](https://lighthome.co/random/best-hdmi-switch) because our projector doesn't have speakers and instead we have a separate 5.1ch speaker system, we use the optical audio out port of this HDMI switch to split the audio from the HDMI input and output it directly to our surround sound setup. This switch also supports the latest HDMI spec up to 4K quality, and has 4 HDMI inputs, 1 HDMI output, 1 digital optical S/PDIF TOSLINK audio output, and 1 RCA (left / right) stereo output, and has a remote control.

If don't need to split audio out separately, we recommend [The Best HDMI Switch](https://lighthome.co/random/best-hdmi-switch). This switch has one more input for a total of 5 HDMI inputs, one HDMI output, and is much cheaper at only $15.
