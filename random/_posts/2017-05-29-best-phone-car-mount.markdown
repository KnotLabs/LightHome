The [Kenu Airframe](http://amzn.to/2qA8vTP) is hands down the best car mount for your phone. It clips right into your car's air vent and securely holds your phone without slipping or dropping it. It fits any iPhone and nearly any Andorid phone, from a tiny iPhone 4s all the way to a Galaxy Note phablet!

You don't own a car you say? Well the [Kenu Airframe](http://amzn.to/2qA8vTP) is the best mount for you because it doubles as a desk stand when you put a credit card/business card/driver's license into the back part - great for watching your saved-for-offline Netflix shows on the train or plane with no wifi. Its also very compact so you can easily keep it in your backpack in case you find yourself in someone else's car and need to mount your phone (note: we don't condone stealing cars just so you can use your [Kenu Airframe](http://amzn.to/2qA8vTP)! Make sure you ask the owner first if they will let you take their car out.)
