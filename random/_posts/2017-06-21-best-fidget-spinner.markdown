If you like fidget spinners, this is hands down the best, most fun, and longest spinning spinner you can get for under $20. I got it to spin for up to 5 minutes and 19 seconds on my first try! What is also super cool about it is that you can remove some of the metal 'arms' so you can customize it however you like! I've tried a lot of fidget spinners, and this one is truly the most fun that I have found - I cannot recommend it highly enough!

Get it while its hot, and make sure to buy the [official, non-counterfeit version](http://amzn.to/2sVLtfo).
